Very tough choice for the 18th spot. Lack in both defensive and forward departments, especially after the sale of Richarlison and Amrabat will mean that Watford won't create enough chances as Deulofeu and Okaka will not be enough to stay up this year. https://t.co/XUN2mv3SuR",4604001507

Replaced Wenger with a manager who has something to prove. Torreira is an Excellent signing. Leno, Litchsteiner and Sokratis are all decent but not the greatest.",968083255734960130

1027626350142808064,1,1027626374478086146,"20th - Cardiff City 

The only newly promoted side I expect to struggle with the premier league this season, they have not strengthened with the same quality as Wolves and Fulham this season, and are signing championship level players. A very simple and easy pick. https://t.co/FtQrhEqta5",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,2,1027626389112061952,"19th - Huddersfield 

David Wagner did a great job last season, despite their business not being great they managed to narrowly escape relegation. However the second season in the premier league is always harder than the first, and with little improvement I see them going down. https://t.co/oOCkzzThr4",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,3,1027626402022129665,"18th - Newcastle 

Possibly the most surprising relegation candidate I have gone with is Newcastle. They have again spent very little, and problems continue with the ownership of the club. Rafa Ben√≠tez will have to work wonders again this year to keep his side up. https://t.co/ydgwPRDUnN",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,4,1027626414990872585,"17th - Brighton 

The side I have gone for to narrowly miss out on relegation is Brighton. The second season will be harder for them, however their business has been good, noticeably signing Iranian forward Alireza, who was the leading goal scorer of the Eredivisie last season. https://t.co/k3sBKOxZdj",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,5,1027626426529443845,"16th - Southampton 

Southampton could struggle to stay up this season, and I‚Äôve got them just staying out of relegation. The departure of Van Dijk for ¬£75m to Liverpool in January has given them funds to work with, however it hasn‚Äôt all been reinvested in the right way. https://t.co/bCEZUvp3AR",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,6,1027626437426200576,"15th - Watford

Watford have had an okay transfer window, the departure of Richarlison will hurt them this season, they got a good amount of money however this has yet to be reinvested. Overall it will be a difficult season, their attacking options are unconvincing. https://t.co/p8GQ4AUId6",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,7,1027626448356556800,"14th - Bournemouth 

Don‚Äôt see Bournemouth having problems this season. Eddie Howe is a great manager, and his side are capable both defensively and going forward. Their transfer window has been quite average, so their squad will lack the quality to finish in the top half. https://t.co/olphuWF7wB",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,8,1027626458955624448,"13th - Burnley 

Although a team with no superstars, Sean Dyche has put together a very hard working solid team. Finishing 7th last season was a huge accomplishment, but they‚Äôll struggle to retain that same consistency this season now being in the Europa League. https://t.co/21zWXdQHTj",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,9,1027626470292828160,"12th - Crystal Palace 

I expect Palace to have a decent season this year, the additions of Kouyate and Meyler are good and will improve their side. Benteke needs a much better season, as he was simply not clinical enough last year. Keeping Zaha is also great, so they‚Äôll do well. https://t.co/hlzOSgGU8y",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,10,1027626481718099968,"11th - Fulham 

Although a newly promoted team, I expect Fulham to finish in 11th this season. Keeping Ryan Sessegnon is brilliant, and the additions of Sch√ºrrle and Seri are very good. Getting goalkeeper Rico on loan is also very good business. Expecting a great season for them. https://t.co/EA5B7yPsFk",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,11,1027626492501610501,"10th - Leicester City 

Selling Mahrez will be a massive loss for them, however goals won‚Äôt be scarce. Vardy is a top striker, and I‚Äôm expecting Iheanacho to have a great season. Maddison from Norwich is also an underrated signing, and defensively they look very strong. https://t.co/s0CWIjEcmF",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,12,1027626505982173186,"9th - Wolves

Predicting a newly promoted team to get a top half finish seems ludicrous, however Wolves have had an unbelievable transfer window, and their squad is looking dangerous. Portuguese midfield duo Neves and Moutinho, Portuguese no.1 Patricio and Jota will be great. https://t.co/x26q7kAIj7",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,13,1027626516098768897,"8th - West Ham 

West Ham have arguably had the best transfer window this season, the appointment of Pellegrini is great, and West Ham look to have a lot of fire power in their attacking options this season. Wilshire, Anderson and Perez a select few brilliant signings. https://t.co/ecJqejrcEC",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,14,1027626528685862915,"7th - Everton 

Another team who have had an excellent window is Everton. Richarlison and Digne are good moves, and if Yerry Mina continues his World Cup form, he‚Äôll be great. The appointment of Marco Silva is a good one, and I expect them to have a much better season than last. https://t.co/UKsv8KAF3q",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,15,1027626540853587968,"6th - Arsenal 

Moving into the top 6, I‚Äôm predicting Arsenal to finish in the 6th spot. A good window, but Emery will have a difficult job. If he can fix their defensive issues then they can very easily break into the top 4 considering their deadly attacking options. https://t.co/RiozYAYIyQ",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,16,1027626550311747586,"5th - Manchester United 

Perhaps the most controversial choice is picking United to miss out on a champions league spot. This season will be a massive test for Mourinho, who‚Äôs United side have had a poor transfer window, failing to sign a much needed CB. A poor season for them https://t.co/cT9dLuDQCk",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,17,1027626561258905601,"4th - Tottenham Hotspur 

A perhaps surprising choice for a champions league choice is Tottenham, failing to bring in a single player this window. However I still rate their side highly, they have a very talented squad and Mauricio Pochettino is a excellent manager. https://t.co/jU9vIOOrC1",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,18,1027626572830986241,"3rd - Chelsea

Sarri will have to and will do a very good job finishing 3rd with this side. He has brought in the acquisitions of Kepa and Kovacic, 2 very promising players who‚Äôll improve. Morata needs a better season, if his finishing improves then Chelsea will have a great year https://t.co/g2tZD3OH6J",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,19,1027626583786512384,"2nd - Liverpool 

My runners up for this years season are Liverpool. I‚Äôm expecting a very positive season. Alisson, Keita, Fabinho and Shaqiri are great transfers, but Liverpool still lack the needed depth to push all the way and win the premier league. A good, not great campaign https://t.co/IFpEZOU7G1",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,20,1027626598533607430,"1st - Man City 

Pep Guardiola has created a world beating Manchester City side, getting an incredible 100 points last season. This season will be more difficult, and there‚Äôs a lot of pressure on City to retain the title, but the squad is good enough to do so, and they‚Äôll win it. https://t.co/PTIlpCnFTa",748231336813551616

Finishing in 2nd place in Championship last season, Cardiff's now in the Premiership. Though I don't really fancy their chances of survival, their squad looked the weakest before the transfer window started and for me, still is. #CCFC https://t.co/6cPCK3apWm",2310351750

They've lost both Van Dijk and Tadic(for me their best attacking mid) now and I just don't see anything special in their squad. Elyounoussi could be great, but he hasn't really proven himself in a big league yet. #Saints https://t.co/l20AswtXL7",2310351750

Similarly to Southampton, I really haven't seen much improvement in their squad and for me, it looks like they'll struggle next season. They've got some young players, who've got talent, but this just doesn't seem to be a good enough squad. #WFC https://t.co/QisKuynDz0",2310351750

They've signed a couple decent players, but still are defensively weak. Though, I think they're just about good enough, to survive. Seems highly unlikely that they'll better their last season's place, which is 12th. #AFCB https://t.co/OFBSDNsfzL",2310351750

Also hard to predict like all the previous ones. They're defensively got a rather good side and if their attack comes through, they could better this place. Transfer-wise, they've not done much, but I feel they'll be good enough.

Now that they're in the Europa League, they might find it hard to also play Premier League at the same time. They've also lost both Heaton and Pope to injury, which might weaken them defensively, but otherwise, they'll be decent enough to atleast finish 15th

Their defence is very good and is certainly a very good reason, why they should finish that high. They've also signed quite a few potentially very good attacking players, which could make their squad pretty dangerous. Could rob some points from the big 6.

The start to last season was rather unexpected, they we're quite good, but just couldn't score. They've now also signed a few very decent players and they've probably got the potential to get top 10, but I think they'll just miss out.

Did a complete squad overhaul with potentially only a few players from last season potentially being in their best XI. Definitely one of the best promoted sides PL has ever seen, but their attack might still be a bit unproven.

They've signed lots of attacking players and they will definitely be dangerous on the attack, but their defence doesn't really look strong enough to challenge for Europe. Pellegrini's a great coach, but not sure if he'll be able to do much with that defence. #WHUFC https://t.co/fIzLbPuUOH",2310351750

Another club, which made a huge overhaul after getting promoted, with lots of bargains. Their attack might potentially be the least proven for Premier League, but overall they look very strong.

Marco Silva's a very good attacking coach and they sure as hell have improved in attack(except at ST though). At the same time, they've improved their defence by quite a bit and if their new CBs fit in quickly, they'll be hard to break through against.

Unai Emery's for me, a very unproven manager, who isn't going to straight up lead Arsenal back to UCL. Their attack might look scary, but their defence still looks like a bunch of clowns. The 3 defensive signings they've signed aren't as good as most think.

Sarri's a great manager, but I can see them struggle defensively this season. Kepa's still young and can make mistakes, nvm Alonso and potentially David Luiz and Rudiger. Morata might still lack confidence to actually start scoring and that could be a problem.

An adventurous right back, this 23-year-old defender has an eye for getting forward and causing problems in the opposition final third.

Last season was one to forget for Montoya, who saw a lot of defensive mistakes creep into his game while with Valencia.

Key for Getafe last season, with his shot-stopping, reflexes and command of area standing out. Guaita is an experienced and imposing presence.

Watched their pre-season game against Real Betis on Saturday and Josh Murphy looks a right livewire. Smithies a decent buy at around ¬£3m and late deals for Arter and Camarasa have slightly improved their slim hopes of survival. They still needed another striker.

Keeping hold of Hazard and Kant√© is the biggest plus. Jorginho is a fantastic buy, Kovacic albeit on loan is a nice move and Kepa is definitely more suited to Sarri‚Äôs style. They definitely wasted a lot of time by not sacking Conte earlier. Should make top 4

Keeping Zaha is a massive boost for them. They also managed to bring in Max Meyer and Kouyate who will help in the midfield. Will probably grab 3/4 pts over Liverpool like they seem to do every season. Roy Hodgson has managed to make them a decent side. https://t.co/eHZFp9qVql",1176971822

Were awful at points last season but seem to have stabilised more recently. Kept hold of Maguire, who will likely partner Evans at the back. Vardy will score 15+ league goals. Maddison seems to be a good player. Mahrez will be missed but they'll be fine. https://t.co/sd1v8iyxjw",1176971822

1027586555542679552,1,1027586568532451328,"1. Liverpool

After last season‚Äôs Champions League heroics, Klopp has added genuine world-class talent in Ke√Øta,  Fabinho and Alisson. If Europe‚Äôs deadliest front 3 continue to shine and Lovren is dislodged by the promising Joe Gomez, anything is possible.

1027586555542679552,2,1027586579756404736,"2. Manchester City

Failing to add depth in midfield could hurt a City side who are hellbent on winning the Champions League. Last season‚Äôs performance surely can‚Äôt be repeated, right?

1027586555542679552,3,1027586595657003009,"3. Arsenal

After clearing out the deadwood and operating shrewdly in the transfer market, Arsenal have the pace and power to compete. Expect Emery to hit the ground running as the players thrive in a fresh, Wenger-Free environment.

Key Player: Aubameyang https://t.co/k4ommsyGp5",2906752875
1027586555542679552,4,1027586608407760896,"4. Chelsea

After months of speculation, Conte was put out of his misery and swapped for fellow countryman Sarri. A late appointment and vastly different style may mean a slow start, but expect Chelsea emulate or even top Napoli‚Äôs exciting performances.

1027586555542679552,5,1027586619812052992,"5. Tottenham Hotspur

Spurs‚Äô lack of transfer activity has bemused many fans and with many of their stars going deep into the World Cup, Pochettino‚Äôs squad could face a tricky season. If they don‚Äôt win a trophy, how long will their golden generation hang around?

Key Player: Kane https://t.co/SdbC9sgTDT",2906752875
1027586555542679552,6,1027586631023439872,"6. Manchester United

Mourinho‚Äôs wrath will be felt this term at Old Trafford as the hapless Ed Woodward failed to sign a top-class centre-back or right-winger. Expect the enigmatic Portuguese to hit the self-destruct button in his infamous third season.

Key Player: Pogba https://t.co/eiMNZwj30h",2906752875
1027586555542679552,7,1027586644550017024,"7. Wolves

Another promoted side in the Top 8? Fulham have smashed the transfer market. Signing a top-half Premier League defence, Barcelona-bound pass-master Seri and deadly inside-forward Sch√ºrrle, Fulham will waltz to the top half of the table.

Selling wantaway winger Mahrez is a huge blow for Leicester, but retaining Harry ‚ÄòSlab Head‚Äô Maguire will nullify the impact. New boys Evans, Maddison and Pereira all look promising, so expect the former champions to push for a top half finish.

It‚Äôs make or break for Bournemouth, who need to ensure long term Premier League survival by increasing stadium capacity from the minute 11,400 capacity Vitality and tying down manager Eddie Howe to a long-term contract.

1027586555542679552,18,1027586782458724353,"18. Brighton

On top-form Brighton can beat anyone in the top flight, yet consistency is the battle for the East Sussex club, with a lack of goals being a real issue for them.

Not enough signings and they still lack quality defensively. Begovic is prone to a mistake but they‚Äôll score plenty of goals through Stanislas, Wilson and King but they‚Äôll just drop down into the Championship. https://t.co/4KgMW8xbcf",3313868511

I don‚Äôt like Gracia and they had a poor window imo. Keeping Doucoure was key and he, as well as Deulofeu and Pereyra, will just keep them above the drop. I expect Gracia to be sacked at some point this season. https://t.co/Sk4fmuvQUO",3313868511

They‚Äôve actually had a decent window imo, and with Rafa in charge they‚Äôve always got a chance of staying up. Ki is one of the most underrated signings of the summer and overall I think their squad has enough to survive. https://t.co/DWZ6GGVLvM",3313868511

They overachieved massively last season and if they reach the EL group stages they could struggle to stay up. A couple of decent signings late on might‚Äôve saved them and they‚Äôll well drilled. Back to reality for the Clarets. https://t.co/CZubpV33qZ",3313868511

A difficult one to predict. They‚Äôre better than they showed last season but Mark Hughes isn‚Äôt the right manager to guide them back to the top half. They‚Äôll improve a lot but they need to find a consistent striker, Austin could be that if he stays fit. https://t.co/V2Q5oZeTBI",3313868511

Some very good signings adding to an already solid squad. They lack Premier League experience but should be able to have a great first season back.

The best of the rest. They saved their window late on and have kept their best players. I actually think Richarlison will be good for the Toffees but they still overpaid for him. Marco Silva‚Äôs a good manager but they‚Äôre still some way off the top 6. https://t.co/M2EG5qgSVh",3313868511

1027576346312986631,1,1027577118056562688,"20th: Cardiff City- Getting here was against the odds for them, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I haven‚Äôt seen them spend as freely as the other two promoted clubs, so all these factors lead me to put them in 20th. Sorry Cardiff fans. https://t.co/V0VQsQqz6D",3188476087
1027576346312986631,2,1027577913615384576,"19th: Huddersfield Town- Ok, they surprised me last year and I‚Äôll give them credit. I was wrong about them, but this year is different. Other teams have gotten better, Huddersfield doesn‚Äôt have the element of surprise on their side, that leads me to putting them here. https://t.co/o6QHTSXt8D",3188476087
1027576346312986631,3,1027578742153986049,"18th: Southampton- So I debated putting them here and in 17th, but I think that Liverpool‚Äôs favorite feeder club might be going down. Hughes saved them last year, will be one of the catalysts for their undoing this year. Saw it with Stoke, we‚Äôll see it with Southampton. https://t.co/gclh4eohsa",3188476087
1027576346312986631,4,1027580512615821318,"17th: Bournemouth- I feel this may be the season where Eddie Howe‚Äôs reliance on players who helped bring them up may cost him, this is the Premier League where teams have spent and Bournemouth haven‚Äôt nearly as much as these other teams. https://t.co/MWsnV1dqYh",3188476087
1027576346312986631,5,1027581351455645696,"16th: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion- I like BHA, they have some good players like Gro√ü and Pr√∂pper. My concern is where are the goals going to come from? Glenn Murray isn‚Äôt getting any younger, plus like Huddersfield their element of surprise is gone, so teams can better prepare. https://t.co/vqVFmvoAnm",3188476087
1027576346312986631,6,1027582776290275334,"15th: Watford- They‚Äôve got some quality players up front, but my concern for Watford is their defense. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd trust Craig Cathcart 100% Ben Foster will provide experience, but I haven‚Äôt seen Watford get better in this window compared to other teams. https://t.co/JdllufBuhe",3188476087
1027576346312986631,7,1027584994544246786,"14th: Crystal Palace- I‚Äôm putting them here thinking they will start off slowly and sell Zaha in January, I don‚Äôt know how in the hell they got Max Meyer, but that‚Äôs a good signing, but I think losing Zaha combined with a slow start will see them in 14th. https://t.co/hBzXy9i7Rx",3188476087
1027576346312986631,8,1027585681286025217,"13th: Fulham- The 2nd of the three promoted clubs, have been making moves all transfer window and I think with quality players like Sessegnon, Seri, and Tom Cairney, Fulham will do just fine to finish mid-table. https://t.co/icK131HJdb",3188476087
1027576346312986631,9,1027586535216934912,"12th: Newcastle United- I like the team they‚Äôve got, Rafa has been working his magic, they got our hometown boy in DeAndre Yedlin, but Rafa has had a tight budget for making signings and I think when teams ahead of them have improved so much, Rafa only has so much magic. https://t.co/01Fgu6o7OI",3188476087
1027576346312986631,10,1027587637400371200,"11th: Leicester City- From Winners to a 12th and a 9th place finish in the years after, losing Riyad Mahrez is a big loss especially to a team like Man City, which is why I have them here, Vardy will get his goals and there will be partying but 11th is where they will finish https://t.co/9OgOeUsXCd",3188476087
1027576346312986631,11,1027588516501381121,"10th: West Ham United- They‚Äôve signed some players, but more importantly have signed a new manager in Pellegrini who has won the Premier League and will demand the best out of his players this alongside some good performances from Felipe Anderson should see them in 10th. https://t.co/EOEa1RLNyj",3188476087
1027576346312986631,12,1027589186381959168,"9th: Burnley- I think what Sean Dyche has done is incredible, I also think with them being in European Football, that requires a certain depth that I don‚Äôt think they have at the moment so their league campaign will falter a bit and see them finishing 9th. https://t.co/fK14zvQd5g",3188476087
1027576346312986631,13,1027590284614369280,"8th: Wolves- The 3rd and best of the promoted teams is Wolves, and boy are they not playing around. Incredible signings like Rui Patricio and Joao Moutinho to go alongside stars like Ruben Neves and Diogo Jota have made this side a threat to challenge for European football. https://t.co/6Cpx2VP14m",3188476087
1027576346312986631,14,1027591226520825856,"7th: Everton- Marco Silva seems like the guy to take over for Big Sam, and with the signings they‚Äôve made, including the ones as I am typing this tweet I can see them really putting pressure on the top 6, assuming they don‚Äôt screw up or have a slow start or anything. https://t.co/l2ggjDK9gp",3188476087
1027576346312986631,15,1027591984548986880,"6th: Tottenham- They haven‚Äôt signed anyone, this current group of players isn‚Äôt capable of winning the league in my opinion, and I think the reason they‚Äôve done so well recently is due to them staying healthy and I don‚Äôt see that happening this year. Which is why they‚Äôre here. https://t.co/cGaWimQY7T",3188476087
1027576346312986631,16,1027593428341673984,"5th: Chelsea- Kepa is a downgrade from Courtois, plus I don‚Äôt think Sarri‚Äôs system will click with players right away, that being said seeing the moves they make in January seeing how Sarri makes his mark on the team having such little time to prepare will judge where they finish https://t.co/roNdStZqzN",3188476087
1027576346312986631,17,1027594277839237120,"4th: Arsenal- The Wenger Era is over, and I believe that Unai Emery alongside the signings like Torreira and Leno will be pretty decent ones, I think that a combo of Lacazette and Aubameyang will score combined at least 30 goals and fire the Gunners into 4th. https://t.co/pkU3rf6emB",3188476087
1027576346312986631,18,1027595284379926528,"3rd: Manchester United- The Red Devils face strong opposition from their two fiercest rivals to challenge for the PL title, but I do believe both those teams have gotten better while United have stayed the same. And we all know about Jose‚Äôs meltdowns which is only inevitable. https://t.co/jgXxjZiTyP",3188476087
1027576346312986631,19,1027596019217850369,"2nd: Liverpool- What can we say about the Scousers? They came within 90 minutes of winning the UCL, then had the best transfer window in all of European football. But they still won‚Äôt beat Man City as I think Oil Money FC have just a little bit better quality and end result. https://t.co/vv0kEdnWSj",3188476087
1027576346312986631,20,1027596740164116481,"1st: Manchester City- As much as it pains me to say it, they‚Äôre the best team and they‚Äôve gotten better, this team set tons of records last year and still found ways to get better somehow.

1027529920275271680,1,1027531336540729345,20th - Cardiff City / I think this one is pretty obvious because they have a manager renowned for getting teams promoted and bringing them back down. Also have a very poor squad compared to the other promoted teams https://t.co/SR1M7gHfqg,3115615235
1027529920275271680,2,1027532263058288641,19th - Newcastle United / The main reason I have Newcastle getting relegated is their players have refused to do media interviews because they have been payed bonuses that they were promised and stuff like that will affect their mentality when the season starts https://t.co/YDAdTcTztd,3115615235
1027529920275271680,3,1027533724756467712,"18th - Southampton FC / I think Southampton will face the consequences of selling their top quality players this season and with the uninspiring appointment of Mark Hughes, for me it seems like there‚Äôs a breakdown in the works https://t.co/GMD1RxR4jQ",3115615235

1027529920275271680,5,1027536987216064518,16th - Watford / I think Watford will be part of the relegation battle aswell this season. The sale of Richarlison and not using that money to reinvest into the squad will hurt them but in my opinion they still have the quality in their squad to avoid the drop https://t.co/Gj2gzyxxCb,3115615235

1027529920275271680,10,1027552004879667200,11th - Fulham / their back and they‚Äôll do really well this season imo. My reason for this is the improvements they‚Äôve made to their squad are fantastic for a promoted team. Seri especially since 12 months ago he was linked to Barcelona and keeping hold of Sessegnon is massive https://t.co/kewAb6QKU7,3115615235
