A near perfect window, strengthened a very weak midfield with some of the best young talent in Europe. Signed a great young keepers who’s already world class and a massive improvement on Karius &amp; Mignolet, and Shaqiri looks like a good back up.",1020257318

Only 3 first team signings might seem like a disaster after they finished outside of the top 4 last season, but Chelsea’s problems were mainly managerial. Kepa is a great replacement for Tibo, and Jorginho and Kovacic are brilliant additions to their midfield.",1020257318

A good window for Arsenal, strengthened upon the weak defence and signed some great young talent. However I doubt they’ll be a title competitor yet, I think this season will be mostly about Emery installing his playstyle and returning to the Champions League.",1020257318

It’s clear to see that, sadly. Benitez still isn’t being backed by Ashley. The money spent has clearly all come from the outgoing deals, however the money acquired for some of those players was good. And their replacements seems like slight improvements.",1020257318

Very tough choice for the 18th spot. Lack in both defensive and forward departments, especially after the sale of Richarlison and Amrabat will mean that Watford won't create enough chances as Deulofeu and Okaka will not be enough to stay up this year. https://t.co/XUN2mv3SuR",4604001507

Replaced Wenger with a manager who has something to prove. Torreira is an Excellent signing. Leno, Litchsteiner and Sokratis are all decent but not the greatest.",968083255734960130

1027626350142808064,0,1027626350142808064,Premier League Predictions for the upcoming season - a thread https://t.co/obTFeI3qLU,748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,1,1027626374478086146,"20th - Cardiff City 

The only newly promoted side I expect to struggle with the premier league this season, they have not strengthened with the same quality as Wolves and Fulham this season, and are signing championship level players. A very simple and easy pick. https://t.co/FtQrhEqta5",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,2,1027626389112061952,"19th - Huddersfield 

David Wagner did a great job last season, despite their business not being great they managed to narrowly escape relegation. However the second season in the premier league is always harder than the first, and with little improvement I see them going down. https://t.co/oOCkzzThr4",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,3,1027626402022129665,"18th - Newcastle 

Possibly the most surprising relegation candidate I have gone with is Newcastle. They have again spent very little, and problems continue with the ownership of the club. Rafa Benítez will have to work wonders again this year to keep his side up. https://t.co/ydgwPRDUnN",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,4,1027626414990872585,"17th - Brighton 

The side I have gone for to narrowly miss out on relegation is Brighton. The second season will be harder for them, however their business has been good, noticeably signing Iranian forward Alireza, who was the leading goal scorer of the Eredivisie last season. https://t.co/k3sBKOxZdj",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,5,1027626426529443845,"16th - Southampton 

Southampton could struggle to stay up this season, and I’ve got them just staying out of relegation. The departure of Van Dijk for £75m to Liverpool in January has given them funds to work with, however it hasn’t all been reinvested in the right way. https://t.co/bCEZUvp3AR",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,6,1027626437426200576,"15th - Watford

Watford have had an okay transfer window, the departure of Richarlison will hurt them this season, they got a good amount of money however this has yet to be reinvested. Overall it will be a difficult season, their attacking options are unconvincing. https://t.co/p8GQ4AUId6",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,7,1027626448356556800,"14th - Bournemouth 

Don’t see Bournemouth having problems this season. Eddie Howe is a great manager, and his side are capable both defensively and going forward. Their transfer window has been quite average, so their squad will lack the quality to finish in the top half. https://t.co/olphuWF7wB",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,8,1027626458955624448,"13th - Burnley 

Although a team with no superstars, Sean Dyche has put together a very hard working solid team. Finishing 7th last season was a huge accomplishment, but they’ll struggle to retain that same consistency this season now being in the Europa League. https://t.co/21zWXdQHTj",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,9,1027626470292828160,"12th - Crystal Palace 

I expect Palace to have a decent season this year, the additions of Kouyate and Meyler are good and will improve their side. Benteke needs a much better season, as he was simply not clinical enough last year. Keeping Zaha is also great, so they’ll do well. https://t.co/hlzOSgGU8y",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,10,1027626481718099968,"11th - Fulham 

Although a newly promoted team, I expect Fulham to finish in 11th this season. Keeping Ryan Sessegnon is brilliant, and the additions of Schürrle and Seri are very good. Getting goalkeeper Rico on loan is also very good business. Expecting a great season for them. https://t.co/EA5B7yPsFk",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,11,1027626492501610501,"10th - Leicester City 

Selling Mahrez will be a massive loss for them, however goals won’t be scarce. Vardy is a top striker, and I’m expecting Iheanacho to have a great season. Maddison from Norwich is also an underrated signing, and defensively they look very strong. https://t.co/s0CWIjEcmF",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,12,1027626505982173186,"9th - Wolves

Predicting a newly promoted team to get a top half finish seems ludicrous, however Wolves have had an unbelievable transfer window, and their squad is looking dangerous. Portuguese midfield duo Neves and Moutinho, Portuguese no.1 Patricio and Jota will be great. https://t.co/x26q7kAIj7",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,13,1027626516098768897,"8th - West Ham 

West Ham have arguably had the best transfer window this season, the appointment of Pellegrini is great, and West Ham look to have a lot of fire power in their attacking options this season. Wilshire, Anderson and Perez a select few brilliant signings. https://t.co/ecJqejrcEC",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,14,1027626528685862915,"7th - Everton 

Another team who have had an excellent window is Everton. Richarlison and Digne are good moves, and if Yerry Mina continues his World Cup form, he’ll be great. The appointment of Marco Silva is a good one, and I expect them to have a much better season than last. https://t.co/UKsv8KAF3q",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,15,1027626540853587968,"6th - Arsenal 

Moving into the top 6, I’m predicting Arsenal to finish in the 6th spot. A good window, but Emery will have a difficult job. If he can fix their defensive issues then they can very easily break into the top 4 considering their deadly attacking options. https://t.co/RiozYAYIyQ",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,16,1027626550311747586,"5th - Manchester United 

Perhaps the most controversial choice is picking United to miss out on a champions league spot. This season will be a massive test for Mourinho, who’s United side have had a poor transfer window, failing to sign a much needed CB. A poor season for them https://t.co/cT9dLuDQCk",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,17,1027626561258905601,"4th - Tottenham Hotspur 

A perhaps surprising choice for a champions league choice is Tottenham, failing to bring in a single player this window. However I still rate their side highly, they have a very talented squad and Mauricio Pochettino is a excellent manager. https://t.co/jU9vIOOrC1",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,18,1027626572830986241,"3rd - Chelsea

Sarri will have to and will do a very good job finishing 3rd with this side. He has brought in the acquisitions of Kepa and Kovacic, 2 very promising players who’ll improve. Morata needs a better season, if his finishing improves then Chelsea will have a great year https://t.co/g2tZD3OH6J",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,19,1027626583786512384,"2nd - Liverpool 

My runners up for this years season are Liverpool. I’m expecting a very positive season. Alisson, Keita, Fabinho and Shaqiri are great transfers, but Liverpool still lack the needed depth to push all the way and win the premier league. A good, not great campaign https://t.co/IFpEZOU7G1",748231336813551616
1027626350142808064,20,1027626598533607430,"1st - Man City 

Pep Guardiola has created a world beating Manchester City side, getting an incredible 100 points last season. This season will be more difficult, and there’s a lot of pressure on City to retain the title, but the squad is good enough to do so, and they’ll win it. https://t.co/PTIlpCnFTa",748231336813551616

Similarly to Southampton, I really haven't seen much improvement in their squad and for me, it looks like they'll struggle next season. They've got some young players, who've got talent, but this just doesn't seem to be a good enough squad. #WFC https://t.co/QisKuynDz0",2310351750

Their defence is very good and is certainly a very good reason, why they should finish that high. They've also signed quite a few potentially very good attacking players, which could make their squad pretty dangerous. Could rob some points from the big 6.

They've signed lots of attacking players and they will definitely be dangerous on the attack, but their defence doesn't really look strong enough to challenge for Europe.

Marco Silva's a very good attacking coach and they sure as hell have improved in attack(except at ST though). At the same time, they've improved their defence by quite a bit and if their new CBs fit in quickly, they'll be hard to break through against.

Sarri's a great manager, but I can see them struggle defensively this season. Kepa's still young and can make mistakes, nvm Alonso and potentially David Luiz and Rudiger. Morata might still lack confidence to actually start scoring and that could be a problem.

Spurs didn't sign anyone in the transfer window, but they didn't also sell anyone important. With quite a few players returning from injury and hopefully finding form soon enough and some others having lots to improve on, I reckon 3rd place should be minimum

Pep's sharks are definitely the favorites to win the league again, possibly the first one to do so since 07-09 United. They've got the best depth in the league, and potentially the best Starting XI too. Only 1 signing, but that's really all they needed.

1027622601252892677,1,1027623007659941888,20. Cardiff City. Who else? Warnock not a PL level coach and the squad is terrible. Doubt they will break 25 points. Really fancy Bobby Reid to do well but won't beat a single top 6 side. Never seen a team more unfancied.,2463442369
1027622601252892677,2,1027623665553289216,"19. Huddersfield. Bit like Cardiff, not enough quality in the side. Think Lossl will be good again but no one in the side will score at least 8 PL goals. Can see them going on a good run in Feb/March but just like Warnock, Wagner got a real job on his hands.",2463442369
1027622601252892677,3,1027624473502117889,"18. Southampton. Very lucky to stay up last year. Have a good side on paper, especially in defence, but have no cutting edge. If Charlie Austin is injured, they should be going down. No longer a defensive side like Koeman/Poch side and no Mané or Lambert. Won't score 30.",2463442369
1027622601252892677,4,1027625536892358658,"17. Watford. Will somehow find a way to stay up. No clue how they're in their 4th season. Deulofeu going to have a stellar year, same for Will Hughes. But defence is woeful, will concede over 60 again and no great #9. Will be great for 7 games but rubbish for the rest.",2463442369
1027622601252892677,5,1027626321432719361,"16. Bournemouth. Bit like Watford, been meh for 3 years. Not been a fan of Eddie Howe in the market. Expect Josh King to score over 10 and Rico to do well at LB, but top 6 away record will be poor again. Somehow win when they need to. Lerma to flop.",2463442369
1027622601252892677,6,1027626911013515266,"15. Brighton. Same position as last year. Very organised side, bit like Burnley, and I've liked their business this summer. Will keep over 10 clean sheets and beat all the sides around them. Pascal Groß to have an even better season, but Murray will struggle.",2463442369
1027622601252892677,7,1027627876823314435,"14. Newcastle. No back-up LB? Joselu still there? No quality striker? Doesn't matter when you have Rafa Benítez. Schär and Dubravka will add a lot. Will struggle early due to fixtures but top 10 by January. Home/defensive record will be one of best out of top 6, don't doubt Rafa.",2463442369
1027622601252892677,8,1027628867022974976,"13. Leicester. Think Puel will get sacked quite early on. Caglar - Maguire is an immense CB pairing and have one of best strikers in the league. Think Ghezzal will be a success like most of their signings but can see them going on a horrible, horrible spell.",2463442369
1027622601252892677,9,1027629407995932673,"12. Crystal Palace. Keep Zaha, survival confirmed. Going to be extremely entertaining and their defence will chip in with 10 - 15 goals. Think Meyer will drop off after a good start. Benteke to surprise everyone.",2463442369
1027622601252892677,10,1027629973769793536,"11. Fulham. Terrific, terrific business and play a good brand of football. Will cause big sides plenty of problems. Vietto/Mitrovic/Schürrle/Seri all to do well and Sessegnon will get a lot of praise. Defense looks error-prone but will be everyone's 2nd team by May.",2463442369
1027622601252892677,11,1027630569319018496,10. Burnley. Don't see them making EL hence a high ranking. Very solid spine and will have a good a big game record. Dyche is the Pulis of our generation. Expect a lot of 1-0s/1-1s from them.,2463442369
1027622601252892677,12,1027630941282488321,"9. West Ham. Expecting them to do well v big teams but struggle v smaller sides. Pellegrini huge coup for them. Yarmolenko to flop, Felipe to be inconsistent but Arnautović/Wilshere will be superb for them. Will have a bad defensive record though.",2463442369

1027622601252892677,15,1027632623483580423,"6. Arsenal. No change in ranking. Defensively still bad. Ramsey/Aubameyang going to have a big year, as will Lacazette but post February they will focus on Europa. But don't know what to make of them. Torreira to be one of signings of summer and Özil to have a great year.",2463442369

Our season depends on injuries, if we get fucked on that front, it could be a return to the promised land that is the championship. Got this weird feeling deeney will bag 15+ and lead us to Europa but I’ve gone for 16th cos that almost certainly won’t happen. https://t.co/9xNRPbhxzt",2608318457

Plenty of talents have left Spanish football, which we’re never a fan of, but here’s a thread of what Premier League and Championship fans can expect from their new additions. 🔎",897840237942013956
1027611017155698688,1,1027612434624851968,"Sergio Rico (Fulham)

Last season saw this talented goalkeeper’s confidence take a substantial hit, with mistakes creeping into his game.

Though he may struggle at times when commanding his box, Sergio Rico’s shot-stopping and reflexes can be utterly jaw dropping on his day. https://t.co/Wz5dUJeMDS",897840237942013956
1027611017155698688,2,1027613417140625408,"Jefferson Lerma (Bournemouth)

Expected to leave Levante long before this summer, now it is time to take the next step.

Technically tidy, but also capable of offering physicality to help protect his defence, Lerma can both destroy and construct play in the centre of midfield. https://t.co/UHGyoFDWkK",897840237942013956
1027611017155698688,3,1027614625901281281,"Marc Navarro (Watford)

An adventurous right back, this 23-year-old defender has an eye for getting forward and causing problems in the opposition final third.

Pacy and with a thunderbolt of a right foot, Navarro is a worthwhile gamble for the very low fee of two million euros. https://t.co/uxuJ4n2b7o",897840237942013956
1027611017155698688,4,1027615607355830272,"Fabian Schär (Newcastle)

Despite Depor’s relegation last season, Schär stood out for his quality on the ball and how positive he was in possession.

Catching the eye with raking passes and surges forward, four million euros is a snip for an experienced ball-playing defender. https://t.co/ssio00tkhG",897840237942013956
1027611017155698688,5,1027617886905532416,"Jonny Castro (Wolves)

Reliable, consistent and very astute defensively, it is hard to pick out any glaring errors over his last few seasons at Celta.

While he is not a modern full back in terms of his attacking output, Jonny is very versatile and is any manager’s dream. https://t.co/CUFSTP5cX0",897840237942013956
1027611017155698688,6,1027620158498586624,"Yerry Mina (Everton)

His chances at Barcelona were limited, but the 23-year-old centre back’s quality in possession was plain to see.

Happy to spray passes around and be adventurous on the ball, Mina also boasts more than enough pace to cover in behind and plenty of height. https://t.co/7AbmvMBSn2",897840237942013956
1027611017155698688,7,1027621664790589440,"Martín Montoya (Brighton)

Last season was one to forget for Montoya, who saw a lot of defensive mistakes creep into his game while with Valencia.

On the offensive, he offers a dangerous delivery with his right foot and pace to overlap, but in his own half he is less convincing. https://t.co/63sVWigz7i",897840237942013956
1027611017155698688,8,1027623532694577152,"Vicente Guaita (Crystal Palace)

Key for Getafe last season, with his shot-stopping, reflexes and command of area standing out. Guaita is an experienced and imposing presence.

While he may not be in the mould of a modern GK, he is capable of pulling off some outstanding saves. https://t.co/qhLArgMAEk",897840237942013956
1027611017155698688,9,1027625097769746434,"Diego Rico (Bournemouth)

Since his Zaragoza days in Segunda, Diego Rico has impressed with his bullish approach and powerful left foot.

Key as a left wing back at modest Leganés, Rico offers the physical profile required to compete and gallivant forward in the Premier League. https://t.co/XjqFf1NGH0",897840237942013956

The unity inside the squad is still there, with exactly the same squad as last season. Only thing that could see this be wrong is tiredness from Europe. https://t.co/nzI6JUaC6Q",782315855619260416
1027601317878030337,14,1027634631779250176,"7. Everton

As much as I don’t want to see them do well, Everton have made some quality signings over the Summer, and have further improved their squad. If they do manage to get Zouma, it could be an even better season for them. However, who knows after a poor pre-season. https://t.co/U0dP3WTfN1",782315855619260416
1027601317878030337,15,1027636291834470403,"6. Manchester United

During the summer transfer window and pre-season, United have not impressed me enough to warrant them any higher than the other teams in the Top 6. The team, ironically, doesn’t seem United with Mourinho as coach, so I think they will finish 6th this season. https://t.co/iKQujECWN6",782315855619260416
1027601317878030337,16,1027637350409678848,"5. Chelsea

Sarri has entered Stamford Bridge with some work to do. Tensions have been in the air for a while regarding lots of players at the club; Hazard and Willian especially. Even with a strong midfield, I think Sarri will need at least a season to get used to the PL. https://t.co/ey1eLVhStP",782315855619260416
1027601317878030337,17,1027637830841970688,"4. Arsenal

Emery has been at Arsenal for a few months now, so will have had time to get used to them. They have a superb front 3, and have made little improvements all around the pitch. I reckon that the Gunners will be able to make the Champions League again this season. https://t.co/HDQLf51Kk7",782315855619260416
1027601317878030337,18,1027638251094528000,"3. Tottenham

They’ve done nothing all Transfer window, yet we’ve seen this a lot with Tottenham and they’ve managed to always be able to hold it together and do well. Pochettino has created such a show of unity at Spurs that I reckon once again they’ll be getting CL football. https://t.co/WbOHEMu0w4",782315855619260416
1027601317878030337,19,1027638797163548678,"2. Liverpool

In many games last season, Liverpool showed how threatening they are. They’ve managed to make huge improvements in their squad, where they needed them most. Still with their great front 3, Liverpool will be able to give a much closer challenge to the title this year https://t.co/sC2K8QuPgN",782315855619260416
1027601317878030337,20,1027639615497428993,"1. Manchester City

Almost unbeatable last season, City have kept every player that played a role in the squad, and added more squad depth with additions like Mahrez. Whilst Liverpool will certainly give them a challenge for the title this season, I reckon City will do it again. https://t.co/K5dnmEkLye",782315855619260416

Watched their pre-season game against Real Betis on Saturday and Josh Murphy looks a right livewire. Smithies a decent buy at around £3m and late deals for Arter and Camarasa have slightly improved their slim hopes of survival. They still needed another striker.

Keeping hold of Hazard and Kanté is the biggest plus. Jorginho is a fantastic buy, Kovacic albeit on loan is a nice move and Kepa is definitely more suited to Sarri’s style. They definitely wasted a lot of time by not sacking Conte earlier. Should make top 4

Keeping Zaha is a massive boost for them. They also managed to bring in Max Meyer and Kouyate who will help in the midfield. Will probably grab 3/4 pts over Liverpool like they seem to do every season. Roy Hodgson has managed to make them a decent side. https://t.co/eHZFp9qVql",1176971822

1027586555542679552,1,1027586568532451328,"1. Liverpool

After last season’s Champions League heroics, Klopp has added genuine world-class talent in Keïta,  Fabinho and Alisson. If Europe’s deadliest front 3 continue to shine and Lovren is dislodged by the promising Joe Gomez, anything is possible.

Key Player: Salah https://t.co/9xo23Bvi4m",2906752875
1027586555542679552,2,1027586579756404736,"2. Manchester City

Failing to add depth in midfield could hurt a City side who are hellbent on winning the Champions League. Last season’s performance surely can’t be repeated, right?

Key Player: de Bruyne https://t.co/V2iht09o0J",2906752875
1027586555542679552,3,1027586595657003009,"3. Arsenal

After clearing out the deadwood and operating shrewdly in the transfer market, Arsenal have the pace and power to compete. Expect Emery to hit the ground running as the players thrive in a fresh, Wenger-Free environment.

Key Player: Aubameyang https://t.co/k4ommsyGp5",2906752875
1027586555542679552,4,1027586608407760896,"4. Chelsea

After months of speculation, Conte was put out of his misery and swapped for fellow countryman Sarri. A late appointment and vastly different style may mean a slow start, but expect Chelsea emulate or even top Napoli’s exciting performances.

Key Player: Jorginho https://t.co/XxMlRiTQ20",2906752875
1027586555542679552,5,1027586619812052992,"5. Tottenham Hotspur

Spurs’ lack of transfer activity has bemused many fans and with many of their stars going deep into the World Cup, Pochettino’s squad could face a tricky season. If they don’t win a trophy, how long will their golden generation hang around?

Key Player: Kane https://t.co/SdbC9sgTDT",2906752875
1027586555542679552,6,1027586631023439872,"6. Manchester United

Mourinho’s wrath will be felt this term at Old Trafford as the hapless Ed Woodward failed to sign a top-class centre-back or right-winger. Expect the enigmatic Portuguese to hit the self-destruct button in his infamous third season.

Key Player: Pogba https://t.co/eiMNZwj30h",2906752875
1027586555542679552,7,1027586644550017024,"7. Wolves

Regardless of your opinion of their affiliation with super-agent Jorge Mendes, Wolves have the strongest squad ever to emerge from the Championship. A strong spine combined with flair and class, Wolves will push for Europe in a spectacular season.

Key Player: Neves https://t.co/tjMCb9rp52",2906752875
1027586555542679552,8,1027586659209162753,"8. Fulham

Another promoted side in the Top 8? Fulham have smashed the transfer market. Signing a top-half Premier League defence, Barcelona-bound pass-master Seri and deadly inside-forward Schürrle, Fulham will waltz to the top half of the table.

Key Player: R. Sessegnon https://t.co/dYQwR4TrWF",2906752875
1027586555542679552,9,1027586674514173953,"9. Everton

After months of courting, Everton finally landed Marco Silva. The Portuguese boss will relish the chance to deploy new boys Richarlison, Digne and Mina with starlets Lookman, Davies and Pickford in an exciting Toffees side.

Key Player: Pickford https://t.co/D2tlnytYZr",2906752875
1027586555542679552,10,1027586685343813633,"10. West Ham

Astute transfer business, a title-winning manager and the owners finally piping down on Twitter. West Ham look set for a big season, but that’s never boded well for the Hammers before...

Key Player: Wilshere https://t.co/ri8cnG6DKS",2906752875
1027586555542679552,11,1027586697440186368,"11. Leicester

Selling wantaway winger Mahrez is a huge blow for Leicester, but retaining Harry ‘Slab Head’ Maguire will nullify the impact. New boys Evans, Maddison and Pereira all look promising, so expect the former champions to push for a top half finish.

Key Player: Vardy https://t.co/dvHp4l10IK",2906752875
1027586555542679552,12,1027586710555774976,"12. Crystal Palace

Retaining talisman Zaha could be as important as David Moyes hiding his daughter from the forward.

1027586555542679552,13,1027586723126161408,"13. Watford

A football purist’s nightmare. The Pozzo control of the Hertfordshire club has had no shortage of drama. Expect their policy of managerial merry-go-round to continue as they attain another mid-table finish.

Key Player: Doucouré https://t.co/QUh9e1FOjo",2906752875
1027586555542679552,14,1027586736380100609,"14. Burnley

After his legend status was cemented with a pub name, Sean Dyche will face a tricky season as Burnley compete in the Europa League, but if there’s one man who is tactically astute to compete on both fronts it’s the ginger Mourinho.

Key Player: GK duo Pope &amp; Heaton https://t.co/5jw7AbBb9R",2906752875
1027586555542679552,15,1027586748593987584,"15. Huddersfield

Huddersfield surprised many last season, and strengthening their defence will allow them to avoid the dreaded second season syndrome.

Key Player: Kongolo https://t.co/hhQhCiRbmE",2906752875
1027586555542679552,16,1027586761000673281,"16. Bournemouth

It’s make or break for Bournemouth, who need to ensure long term Premier League survival by increasing stadium capacity from the minute 11,400 capacity Vitality and tying down manager Eddie Howe to a long-term contract.

Key Player: Lewis Cook https://t.co/Ev7Rvchgw3",2906752875
1027586555542679552,17,1027586771859714048,"17. Newcastle

Benítez has worked miracles with a severely underfunded squad, but he’ll need one more this season as the Toon’s Premier League status will go down to the wire.

Key Player: Lascelles https://t.co/wZCjDLs5wu",2906752875
1027586555542679552,18,1027586782458724353,"18. Brighton

On top-form Brighton can beat anyone in the top flight, yet consistency is the battle for the East Sussex club, with a lack of goals being a real issue for them.

Key Player: Groß https://t.co/kSEMANKLSw",2906752875
1027586555542679552,19,1027586792864866304,"19. Cariff

Despite finishing above Fulham in the Championship, Cardiff lack the necessary quality to remain in the top flight. However, they will not be forgotten quickly, look out for manager Warnock’s hilariously angry press conferences.

Key Player: Morrison https://t.co/rg8Ip6CiQX",2906752875
1027586555542679552,20,1027586805053440000,"20. Southampton

Saints are a shadow of the team they used to be, and passionate but tactically naive Hughes will only add to this problem. Expect the Welshman to be gone by Christmas, with Alan Pardew filling in to relegate yet another team.

1027576346312986631,2,1027577913615384576,"19th: Huddersfield Town- Ok, they surprised me last year and I’ll give them credit. I was wrong about them, but this year is different. Other teams have gotten better, Huddersfield doesn’t have the element of surprise on their side, that leads me to putting them here. https://t.co/o6QHTSXt8D",3188476087
1027576346312986631,3,1027578742153986049,"18th: Southampton- So I debated putting them here and in 17th, but I think that Liverpool’s favorite feeder club might be going down. Hughes saved them last year, will be one of the catalysts for their undoing this year. Saw it with Stoke, we’ll see it with Southampton. https://t.co/gclh4eohsa",3188476087
1027576346312986631,4,1027580512615821318,"17th: Bournemouth- I feel this may be the season where Eddie Howe’s reliance on players who helped bring them up may cost him, this is the Premier League where teams have spent and Bournemouth haven’t nearly as much as these other teams. https://t.co/MWsnV1dqYh",3188476087

Lost their main player on Mahrez. They’ll find it difficult without to not feel the absence within the team. They’ll also struggle for goals with Vardy getting older, and they don’t really have any fantastic players anymore. Back to a mid table team for me. https://t.co/PcGm9v1b9I",2448186806

I’m liking this new look to Arsenal. Emery seems like a good manager but not a top class one like Pep. They have a very good squad, especially in attack. Defence is still a shambles. Leno is mistake prone and Koscielny and Mustafi are terrible. https://t.co/iwCdMt9YsY",2448186806

Too much hype around this club. Very good attack as we seen last season but they don’t have the squad depth to compete in a title race. Spent massive amounts of money so realistically they should be title contenders, but for me they’re not quite their yet. https://t.co/yRPQ5BVjrP",2448186806

1027529920275271680,1,1027531336540729345,20th - Cardiff City / I think this one is pretty obvious because they have a manager renowned for getting teams promoted and bringing them back down. Also have a very poor squad compared to the other promoted teams https://t.co/SR1M7gHfqg,3115615235
1027529920275271680,2,1027532263058288641,19th - Newcastle United / The main reason I have Newcastle getting relegated is their players have refused to do media interviews because they have been payed bonuses that they were promised and stuff like that will affect their mentality when the season starts https://t.co/YDAdTcTztd,3115615235
1027529920275271680,3,1027533724756467712,"18th - Southampton FC / I think Southampton will face the consequences of selling their top quality players this season and with the uninspiring appointment of Mark Hughes, for me it seems like there’s a breakdown in the works https://t.co/GMD1RxR4jQ",3115615235
1027529920275271680,4,1027535034369171457,"17th - Huddersfield Town / I think Huddersfield will avoid the drop but just about, I think with Aaron Mooy staying at the club he’ll carry them for another season and with the signings of Kongolo and Durm they will hopefully sure up their defence for the upcoming season https://t.co/dvFXPE0hZM",3115615235
1027529920275271680,5,1027536987216064518,16th - Watford / I think Watford will be part of the relegation battle aswell this season. The sale of Richarlison and not using that money to reinvest into the squad will hurt them but in my opinion they still have the quality in their squad to avoid the drop https://t.co/Gj2gzyxxCb,3115615235

1027482785588686848,13,1027486713067778052,"@FactOrDixon He had played both CB and CM at youth level. I think we were short at CB, so he slotted in there, but I think his more natural position is CM. We were overstocked in CM last year, and it would have been dangerous to throw him in there so young. He’s a calm cultured player though.",442259414
1027482785588686848,14,1027487489412530176,@dutts_87 I just think Drinkwater is on huge wages and Chelsea apparently want a big loan fee for him. Just think it's a waste of money if im honest.,298087201

It’s amazing how many goals last season could be tracked to him, Zabaleta or Hart. In my opinion hard got grief for some of the mistakes of the other 2.",364185497
1027482785588686848,17,1027487981001748480,"@FactOrDixon Oh absolutely, but youngsters making mistakes isn’t a blight on quality so much as experience. It’s expected! I’m glad that youth is being given a chance, despite the spending!

A lot of our goals conceded came from lazy midfielding as well.

Hart is a joke of a keeper, btw!",442259414

1027482785588686848,20,1027488673682673664,@dutts_87 Spending has been really interesting this year. How Wolves and Fulham can spend so much without breaking FFP rules escapes me slightly. Still tip at least one of those or both to have trouble settling the squad though,364185497

1027404172080177152,1,1027405193581867008,20: Cardiff City. The newly promoted team. I think they will get relegated imo because they haven’t made any signings and they’re squad isn’t that strong to stay up and they will struggle. https://t.co/8Zys5MK3x1,1524682904
1027404172080177152,2,1027406135656148992,19: Huddersfield. A team that stayed up last season but this year I think they will struggle and go down. Haven’t strengthened enough to stay up even tho they have a very good manager in Wagner but they will go down. https://t.co/EuLrW5uP6b,1524682904
1027404172080177152,3,1027407074576269313,18: Watford. A team who had a decent season last year but this year I don’t think they have what it takes to stay up. They have lost a very good player in Richarlison. Haven’t strengthened as well so I think they will get relegated. https://t.co/mCaS6UAr9j,1524682904
1027404172080177152,4,1027407741185404929,17: Bournemouth. They will just do enough to stay up imo. Have a very good manager in Howe and he will keep them up although they will struggle a lot. Between them and Watford but Bournemouth will do enough. Have quality players as well https://t.co/Cnj4qlcwEu,1524682904
1027404172080177152,5,1027409072683986945,16: Newcastle. They have not strengthened and won’t have a great campaign. But I think Rafa will keep them up even he has not been backed this year. But they have the quality to stay up. https://t.co/Nr9t1mKNVl,1524682904
1027404172080177152,6,1027409942742032384,15: Southampton. They will struggle to stay up because they haven’t strengthened and their style of football is very boring. They haven’t done enough business as well but they have some decent players to help them so they can stay up. https://t.co/1oz8nLTzEP,1524682904
1027404172080177152,7,1027411211367972869,14: Brighton. They will have a good campaign imo they stayed up last season and they will build on that from last season. https://t.co/yFGWuxnS0R,1524682904
