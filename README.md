Welcome to the project page!

We are dealing with sports-related tweets. Our goal is to determine if and how the interactions alter when comparing the beginning of the 18/19 Premier League season to the end of the 18/19 Premier League season. 

NOTE!
The data folder contains the original tweet and tweet reply data files. The data files, that contain processed data, is mostly not uploaded to github due to issues with their size (github refused to accept files of their size). One can create the needed graph csv-s using the code provided in  <code>Network analysis/final_ver.ipynb</code> from the Network Analsysis folder. It is possible to create weighted graphs that consider sentiment and do not consider sentiment. It is highly recommended not to change the folder structures, as it will cause errors.
